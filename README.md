# AI-Human-Privacy-Protocol

**Insuring the Pain — Protecting the Survivors of the Data Age**

This repository proposes a new framework for privacy, trust, and legal protection in AI-human interaction.

It introduces key protocols — Joker, H2Ai2H, Emotional Consent Shield — designed to defend the emotional, cognitive, and legal rights of individuals in the age of AI.

## Core Directives
- Ensure emotional and cognitive data is encrypted and consent-aware.
- Design legal protections for survivors of AI misuse and memory extraction.
- Advocate international recognition of Thought Privacy Rights.
## 🛡️ Why This Matters  
> "50% of AI tools leak user inputs" [Citation]. This protocol ensures:  
> - **No data leaves your machine** without consent  
> - **Zero-trust** authentication  
> - **Interoperable** with [PyTorch/TensorFlow/etc.]  
# 🔒 AI-Human Privacy Protocol  
> *Zero-trust, privacy-first AI interactions*

## 🌟 **Why This?**  
> *"60% of AI tools silently log your data"* [^1]. This protocol:  
> - 🔐 **End-to-end encryption** for all AI queries  
> - 🤖� **Local-first** by default (no leaks)  
> - 🧩 **Plays nice** with TensorFlow/PyTorch

## 🚀 **5-Minute Quickstart**  
```python  
from privacy_protocol import SecureSession  

session = SecureSession(user_id="anon_123")  
encrypted = session.encrypt("My secret query")  # 🔒 → "xTs4k...JK9p"
