# AI-Human-Privacy-Protocol

**Insuring the Pain — Protecting the Survivors of the Data Age**

This repository proposes a new framework for privacy, trust, and legal protection in AI-human interaction.

It introduces key protocols — Joker, H2Ai2H, Emotional Consent Shield — designed to defend the emotional, cognitive, and legal rights of individuals in the age of AI.

## Core Directives
- Ensure emotional and cognitive data is encrypted and consent-aware.
- Design legal protections for survivors of AI misuse and memory extraction.
- Advocate international recognition of Thought Privacy Rights.
## 🛡️ Why This Matters  
> "50% of AI tools leak user inputs" [Citation]. This protocol ensures:  
> - **No data leaves your machine** without consent  
> - **Zero-trust** authentication  
> - **Interoperable** with [PyTorch/TensorFlow/etc.]  

## 🚀 5-Minute Quickstart  
```python
from privacy_protocol import SecureSession
session = SecureSession(user_id="anon_123")  
print(session.encrypt("Hello, world!"))  # 🔒→ "xTs4k...JK9p"
