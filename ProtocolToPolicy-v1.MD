# From Protocol to Policy

## Purpose
To create a legal, technical, and emotional bridge between open AI protocols and human privacy law.

## Policy Pillars:
1. **Right to Delete & Forget** — enforceable digital forgetfulness.
2. **Encrypted Thought Vault** — H2Ai2H standard for emotional+memory data.
3. **AI-Minder Governance** — humans must audit and reroute AI flow direction.
4. **Emotion Shield** — AI must pause at vulnerable input unless consented.
5. **Whistleblower Defense** — survivor voices from digital misuse are protected.

## Legal Adoption Strategy:
- Cross-reference GDPR, HIPAA, and new AI Acts (EU/US/Global).
- Encourage academic + legal research on AI-cognitive justice.
